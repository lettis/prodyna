- all generator functions (e.g. in 'reaction_coords.R') should
  update the project object and return it, essentially by returning
  project()

- plotting of pops, etc should be in 'plotting.R', under
  'plt.[...]', not in 'clustering'.

- plotting of pops must get more performant, e.g. by using
  histograms with number of bins say 10% of nrow(data).
